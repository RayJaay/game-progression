# Readme

The game progression app is a non-trivial Angular app you can build to
learn the fundamentals of Angular along with the current best practices.
It is designed to be completed in about 4-5 weeks while on the bench with
the assistance of an experienced Angular developer/architect to provide
on-going mentoring and code reviews. Beyond this, it is intended to be
self-driven.

To start, create your own project in GitHub and copy `db.json` and the
profile image in the `assets` folder over to your project. From there,
you can build out your version of the game progression application.
